Availability Estimate

For this estimations, we assume we have a Multi-AZ and Multi-Region database. It means, that the data is synchronously replicated between the Availability Zones (AZ), and asynchronously copied to the Read Replica on the secondary region.

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
The RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for a single AZ outage is the maximum duration of a service interruption for switching from one AZ to the standby one in the same region (inside the subnet group).

- If the outage doesn't occur in the active AZ, the users won't be affected by the downtime, so the RTO is zero.
- If the outage occurs in the active AZ: Since we configured the DB to be Multi-AZ, Amazon RDS will detect and failover on the main AZ and promote the corresponding standby instance to primary automatically. It takes typically around 60-120 seconds.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
The RTO for a single region outage is the maximum duration of a service interruption for switching from one region to another.

- If the outage doesn't occur in the active region, the users won't be affected by the downtime, so the RTO is zero.
- If the outage occurs in the active AZ: As we set the the Secondary region as being a Read replica, we have continuous replication of our data between the regions. Since the Secondary instance is already active, we will need to promote it as the master instance. Also it is necessary to reconfigure the address of the database on the applications. These steps are not automatically. It can take around 60-120 minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
The RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is the maximum duration that we will lose data during the switch between the two Availability Zones.

- If the outage doesn't occur in the active region, the secondary AZ won't lose data.
- If the outage occurs in the active AZ: This will be similar to the RTO, because the data is being copied synchronously from one place to the other. So we can expect around 60-120 seconds.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
This the maximum duration that we will lose data during the switch between the two Regions.

- If the outage doesn't occur in the active region, the secondary Region won't lose data.
- If the outage occurs in the active Region: This will be similar to the RTO, because the data is being copied from one place to the other. So we can expect around the same time frame (60-120min).
